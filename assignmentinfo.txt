It was great to see your presentations last week.  I've heard from a few groups about wanting more time to complete the analysis and, therefore, more time for the final report and executive summary for the Social Impact Project.  While I do not want the work to extend into Spring Break, I want successful projects.  To support this, I am moving the deadline slightly--I will accept final reports and executive summaries until Monday, March 14th at 10AM.  NYU Classes will be updated on Monday to reflect this new time.
 
Remember that in addition to the group report, each student is responsible for completing and submitting an executive summary.  In case you are unfamiliar with this type of document, we have created a guide with reference to examples.  Please find it attached.
 
I urge everyone to review the Social Impact Project document for assignment requirements and submission directions.  We have not strictly enforced late or incomplete submissions thus far.  Let this serve as a reminder that submission directions and deadlines are part of completing an assignment.
 
See you tomorrow.
 
Best,
Logan
