Commute Time Data
=================

The commute time data was created by using Open Trip Planner, New York City
transportation network data and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LODES)
data.  Open Trip Planner is an open source project which can calculate travel
times between two points for a variety of modes.  It was configured with
GTFS data for New York City buses, subways, railroad and ferries as well as road
network data from Open Street Maps.  Once configured, the public transit commute
time between the center of each census tract in New York City was calculated.
Finally, LODES data was used to calculate a single weighted average commute time
for each census tract, X, by multiplying the commute time between X and every
other census tract, Y, by the number of commuters who commute between X and Y,
then divided by the total number of workers who live in X.  So this metric takes
into account the level of transit service as well as the proximity to jobs.

City-wide Predictive Model
==========================

After understanding what drives demand for dollar vans, we also wanted to see
if there are other parts of the city that also meet that demand. To do that,
we built a predictive model using support vector machines to learn how to
classify dollar van origins and destinations.  The algorithm was provided
commute time, demographic and jobs data as input and a flag indicating whether
the tract was either an origin or destination for dollar vans.  We divided the
2160 census tracts in New York City into 66% training and 33% test set.

For origins, the model correctly classified 94% of the actual dollar van origins
in the training set and 80% for the test set. For places that are not actually
dollar van origins, the model identified 20% of the training set and 24% of the
test set, which we could interpret as places where there could potentially be
demand for dollar vans.  The map below shows the results when the model is run
on all the census tracts:

For destinations, the model correctly classified 100% of the actual dollar van destinations
in the training set and 74% for the test set. For places that are not actually
dollar van destinations, the model identified 23% of the training set and 25% of the
test set, which we could interpret as places where there could potentially be
demand for dollar vans to run to.  The map below shows the results when the model is run
on all the census tracts:

The model identifies places in Flatbush, centered around Utica and Eastern
Parkway as potential destinations.  This is a destination for current dollar
vans because of the subway line there, but this gets at a flaw in our method of
choosing how to draw the boundaries for origins/destinations because the area
as a whole is not much of a destination.  But the model picks up on that and
suggests other areas around there may also be destinations.
